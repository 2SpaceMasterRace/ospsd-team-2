"""Dependency-injection factory for cloud storage clients.

This module manages the global registry that maps the abstract interface to a
concrete implementation. It is intentionally separate from ``client.py`` so that
the interface definition (``CloudStorageClient``) has zero coupling to the DI
mechanism.

Usage pattern:

1. The implementation package calls ``register_client`` at import time,
   passing a *factory callable* — a zero-argument function that constructs and
   returns a fully initialised ``CloudStorageClient`` instance:

       # in aws_client_impl/__init__.py
       from cloud_storage_client_api.factory import register_client
       register_client(get_client_impl)

2. Application code imports the implementation package (triggering step 1)
   then calls ``get_client()`` to receive a ready-to-use instance:

       import aws_client_impl  # registers S3Client factory as side-effect
       from cloud_storage_client_api.factory import get_client
       client = get_client()

This separation follows the Dependency Inversion Principle: the interface
package defines the contract, the implementation package fulfils it, and
neither depends on the other directly.
