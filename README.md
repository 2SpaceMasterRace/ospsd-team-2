## Dependencies
These project relies on these excellent libraries:

* `ruff` - An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. 
* `ty` - An extremely fast Python type checker and language server, written in Rust.
* `pytest` - The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.
